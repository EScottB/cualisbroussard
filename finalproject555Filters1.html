<h2>Filters</h2>
	<h3> In general</h3>
	<p>
    	The filtering section of a retrieval system is meant to refine the search that a user has requested. The NGA Library’s filtering system is specialized to meet the needs of art historians and that comes with advantages and disadvantages. A user can get very specific with their filtering tags and find the exact search result they are looking for with no other extraneous results if done correctly. A key component of the filtering system is how the filters update with each application. With each consecutive application, the filters become more and more specific and replace the old ones from previous applications.
</p>
<p>However, this is only true once you learn the specific filtering system of NGA and know exactly what content you are looking for. The disadvantages are that the user must learn the filtering system to use it effectively. Because it actively changes and updates what filters are available with each progressive application of filters, meaning the user will have to remember filters or refresh their search if they forget to add one and cannot find it again.

<h3> Nielsen</h3>
<p>
Looking at Nielson’s Heuristics, it does well with #1, Visibility and System status, but needs improvement on #4, Consistency and Standards, and #6, Recognition and Recall.

		<dt>#1. </dt>
<dd>It’s loading animations are minimal but consistent, and the active filters are shown above the filter selections.</dd>
		<dt>#4.</dt>
<dd> Comparing it to the Mullen Library Search Catalog, the filtering system of NGA mostly meets standards, but deviates with its replacement filter system. When selecting a format, for example, the entire format section disappears after application and the user must delete the filter for it to return.
</dd>
		<dt> #6.</dt>
<dd>The replacement filter system forces the user to recall past filters in case they make a mistake and missed a needed filter.
