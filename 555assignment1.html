    	<h1>Project Gutenberg</h1>
    	<h2>Background, Content, and Opinion</h2>
    	<p>
    	<sec>Project Gutenberg was created in the year 1971, along with the first ever ebook, by Michael S. Hart as a way to read digital copies of books for free. Project Gutenberg does this for older books that have entered the public domain.
 <article>Project Gutenberg is known not only for its open access titles but also for being completely community run with everyone who digitizes the books and keeps the website updated being volunteers.</article>

 <h2> Who Uses Project Gutenberg?</h2>
 <article>As it is a community sourced collection and is run by volunteers, many of its most avid users also add books to the collection. As the website is free to use, anyone can go in and read any title they want. <br> <sec>The most read books on the site are early modern classics, biographies and field manuals. This would imply that most users access Project Gutenberg for research or study. For example, I used Project Gutenberg to read Volumes 1 and 2 of “The Life and Correspondences of Sir Anthony Panizzi, KCB” by Louis Fagan to write a biographical analysis for a different class.</sec></article>

        	<h2>Searchability</h2>
        	<sec>The Project Gutenberg search bar is sorted by popularity. What is most popular is determined by the number of downloads on the title. It will show different searchable categories before showing the listed results. The categories are:  authors, subject headings, and bookshelves. When looking up “animals” it will show 1 author, 140 subject headings, and 8 bookshelves.</sec><br>

        	<article><h2> Conclusion</h2>
        	<sec> As I perused the website, I really appreciated Project Gutenberg's simple design and "old internet" aesthetic. I think the  Paypal and social media buttons need to be updated and the font size could be increased to improve readabiltiy, but I truly hesitate to suggest any other changes. Project Gutenberg's <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/about/background/free_ebook.html"> philosophy</a> stays the driving force of its digital library, and you can see that in its accessibility. A user does not need a specific "Project Gutenberg" app to read the ebooks, and they can be downloaded to most e-readers and mobile devices. There is also a growing collection of <a href="https://marhamilresearch4.blob.core.windows.net/gutenberg-public/Website/index.html"> audiobooks</a> that are community sourced as well. Overall, the Project Gutenberg website is simple and streamlined in a way that anyone can use it and is a great example of the old addage, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"</sec>
